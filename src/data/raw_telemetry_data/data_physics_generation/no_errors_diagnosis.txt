1600_collection:
	- Satellite starts at 2000 altitude.
	- Satellite's mission is to collect some data at 1600, so it uses the thrusters to get there.
	- Satellite must consistently use the thrusters a little bit to stay still at 1600 while collecting data.
	- Satellite will return to 2000 (if there's time) after it finishes collecting data at 1600.
